# Basic Statistical Functions #
### by Michele Morelli ###

The new term is approaching, and I found myself refreshing some statistics for the upcoming modules.

I thought it would be a good idea to write down a couple of simple Python methods to help me refresh the basics (and the symbols!).

Just to make sure that everything is working as it should, I used numpy's methods to double-check in the pytests.

To run it:

    $python3 stats.py [optional: put a list of number as arguments]

So for example:

    $python3 stats.py 23 32 43 2342 342 34 234 234 2342 34 34


Enjoy!
